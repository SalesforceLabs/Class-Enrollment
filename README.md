# Class-Enrollment

Companies can use Class Enrollment for AppExchange to monitor student enrollment for the courses they offer and to track the internal — and external — classes their employees attend.

Class Enrollment provides a consolidated framework from which to run training courses and manage student enrollment. Companies can use it to track the topics and schedules of the classes they offer, their popularity, and who’s enrolling in and teaching them.

Whether your training programs are aimed at fee-paying customers or are open only to your employees, Class Enrollment can help ensure that you are making the best use of your training resources. It gives you information to help students find alternative offerings when classes are reaching capacity.

You can easily pull up a list of all the classes being offered and find out which times and topics are attracting the most students. The application also gives you a quick view into which trainers are teaching which courses and keeps a record of each employee’s completed courses.

You can install the published version of this package via the AppExchange listing: https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000016aVI&tab=d
